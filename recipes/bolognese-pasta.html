        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Bolognese pasta is a hearty and savory Italian dish, featuring pasta, usually tagliatelle or spaghetti, coated with a rich Bolognese sauce. The sauce, originating from Bologna, is a slow-cooked meat sauce made from ground beef or a blend of meats, simmered with tomatoes, onions, carrots, celery, wine, and a touch of milk or cream for added depth and richness. This deeply flavorful and comforting sauce is traditionally served over al dente pasta and often garnished with grated Parmesan cheese. It's a classic, satisfying dish renowned for its robust taste and heartwarming qualities.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, minced</li>
            <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can Italian plum tomatoes</li>
            <li>½ pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>6 ounces tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 carrots, shredded</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>½ cup chicken stock</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pound pasta</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion, bacon, and garlic in hot oil until bacon is browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer bacon mixture to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</li>
            <li>Place the same large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef and pork in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</li>
            <li>Stir bacon mixture, tomatoes, mushrooms, tomato sauce, carrots, celery, wine, stock, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper into meat mixture. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook in boiling water until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Serve sauce over hot pasta.</li>
        </ol>
